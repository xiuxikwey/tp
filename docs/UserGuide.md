<box type="info" seamless>

**Reading the command guide:**<br>

* Words in `UPPER_CASE` should be replaced with real values.<br>
  e.g. `client n/NAME` should be used as `client n/John Doe`.

* Items in square brackets are optional.<br>
  e.g `[t/TAG]` can be ignored.

* Items with `…`​ can be used multiple times.<br>
  e.g. `[t/TAG]…​` can be used as `t/friend t/family`

* Inputs can be in any order.<br>
  e.g. if the command specifies `n/NAME p/PHONE_NUMBER`, `p/PHONE_NUMBER n/NAME` is also acceptable.

* If you are using a PDF version of this document, be careful when copying and pasting commands that span multiple lines as space characters surrounding line-breaks may be omitted when copied over to the application.

## FAQ

**Q**: How do I transfer my data to another Computer?<br>
**A**: Install the app in the other computer and overwrite the empty data file it creates with the file that contains the data of your previous AddressBook home folder.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Known issues

1. **When using multiple screens**, if you move the application to a secondary screen, and later switch to using only the primary screen, the GUI will open off-screen. The remedy is to delete the `preferences.json` file created by the application before running the application again.
2. **If you minimize the Help Window** and then run the `help` command (or use the `Help` menu, or the keyboard shortcut `F1`) again, the original Help Window will remain minimized, and no new Help Window will appear. The remedy is to manually restore the minimized Help Window.

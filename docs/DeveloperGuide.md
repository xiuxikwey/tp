## **Design**

### Architecture

<puml src="diagrams/ArchitectureDiagram.puml" width="280" />

The ***Architecture Diagram*** shows the high-level design of the app.
It is a Model-View-Controller design, where
* The user interacts with the [**`UI`**](#ui-component)...
* Requested changes are passed through the [**`Logic`**](#logic-component) interface...
* These changes are reflected in the [**`Model`**](#model-component) and [**`Storage`**](#storage-component)...
* And the [**`UI`**](#ui-component) listens for and displays changes accordingly.

### Sequence of program execution

**`Main`** (consisting of classes [`Main`](https://github.com/AY2526S2-CS2103T-F14-2/tp/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/Main.java)
and [`MainApp`](https://github.com/AY2526S2-CS2103T-F14-2/tp/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/MainApp.java)) is in charge of the app launch and shut down.
* At app launch, it initializes the other components in the correct sequence, and connects them up with each other.
* At shut down, it shuts down the other components and invokes cleanup methods where necessary.

[**`Commons`**](https://github.com/AY2526S2-CS2103T-F14-2/tp/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/commons) provides functionalities to other components.

User commands generally follow the execution sequence below.

<puml src="diagrams/ArchitectureSequenceDiagram.puml" width="574" />

Each of the four main components (also shown in the diagram above),

* defines its *API* in an `interface` with the same name as the Component.
* implements its functionality using a concrete `{Component Name}Manager` class (which follows the corresponding API `interface` mentioned in the previous point).

For example, the `Logic` component defines its API in the `Logic.java` interface
and implements its API in the `LogicManager.java` class.
Components are called through their interfaces to abstract implementation details from other classes.

<puml src="diagrams/ComponentManagers.puml" width="300" />

The sections below give more details of each component.

### UI component

The **API** of this component is specified in [`Ui.java`](https://github.com/AY2526S2-CS2103T-F14-2/tp/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/Ui.java)

<puml src="diagrams/UiClassDiagram.puml" alt="Structure of the UI Component"/>

The UI consists of a `MainWindow` that is made up of parts e.g.`CommandBox`, `ResultDisplay`, `PetPersonListPanel`, `StatusBarFooter` etc. All these, including the `MainWindow`, inherit from the abstract `UiPart` class which captures the commonalities between classes that represent parts of the visible GUI.

Additionally, `PetPersonCard` displays a client on the right and all the pets they own on the left. Hence, it contains 1 `PersonCard` and any number of `PetCard` objects.
This ensures that all pets of a client are shown together, which is easier for our users to handle.

The `UI` component uses the JavaFX UI framework. The layout of these UI parts are defined in matching `.fxml` files that are in the `src/main/resources/view` folder. For example, the layout of the [`MainWindow`](https://github.com/AY2526S2-CS2103T-F14-2/tp/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/MainWindow.java) is specified in [`MainWindow.fxml`](https://github.com/AY2526S2-CS2103T-F14-2/tp/tree/master/src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml)

The `UI` component,

* executes user commands using the `Logic` component.
* listens for changes to `Model` data so that the UI can be updated with the modified data.
* keeps a reference to the `Logic` component, because the `UI` relies on the `Logic` to execute commands.
* depends on some classes in the `Model` component, as it displays both `Pet` and `Person` objects residing in the `Model`.

* For more information about executing user commands, refer to classes `MainWindow` and `CommandBox`.
* For more information about listening for changes, refer to class `PetPersonListPanel`.
* For more information about the `File` and `Help` buttons, refer to `MainWindow.fxml`.

### Logic component

**API** : [`Logic.java`](https://github.com/AY2526S2-CS2103T-F14-2/tp/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/Logic.java)

Here's a (partial) class diagram of the `Logic` component:

<puml src="diagrams/LogicClassDiagram.puml" width="550"/>

The sequence diagram below illustrates the interactions within the `Logic` component, taking `execute("deleteClient 1")` API call as an example.

<puml src="diagrams/DeleteSequenceDiagram.puml" alt="Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `deleteClient 1` Command" />

<box type="info" seamless>

**Note:** The lifeline for `DeletePersonCommandParser` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline continues till the end of diagram.

</box>

How the `Logic` component works:

1. When `Logic` is called upon to execute a command, it is passed to an `AddressBookParser` object which in turn creates a parser that matches the command (e.g., `DeletePersonCommandParser`) and uses it to parse the command.
2. This results in a `Command` object (more precisely, an object of one of its subclasses e.g., `DeletePersonCommand`) which is executed by the `LogicManager`.
3. The command can communicate with the `Model` when it is executed (e.g. to delete a person).<br>
   Note that although this is shown as a single step in the diagram above (for simplicity), in the code it can take several interactions (between the command object and the `Model`) to achieve.
4. The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is returned back from `Logic`.

Here are the other classes in `Logic` (omitted from the class diagram above) that are used for parsing a user command:

<puml src="diagrams/ParserClasses.puml" width="600"/>

How the parsing works:
* When called upon to parse a user command, the `AddressBookParser` class creates an `XYZCommandParser` (`XYZ` is a placeholder for the specific command name e.g., `AddPersonCommandParser`) which uses the other classes shown above to parse the user command and create a `XYZCommand` object (e.g., `AddPersonCommand`) which the `AddressBookParser` returns back as a `Command` object.
* All `XYZCommandParser` classes (e.g., `AddPersonCommandParser`, `DeletePersonCommandParser`, ...) inherit from the `Parser` interface so that they can be treated similarly where possible e.g, during testing.

### Model component
**API** : [`Model.java`](https://github.com/AY2526S2-CS2103T-F14-2/tp/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/Model.java)

<puml src="diagrams/ModelClassDiagram.puml" width="450" />

The `Model` component,

* stores the address book data i.e., all `Person` (client) objects (which are contained in a `UniquePersonList` object).
* stores the currently 'selected' `Person` objects (e.g., results of a search query) as a separate _filtered_ list which is exposed to outsiders as an unmodifiable `ObservableList<Person>` that can be 'observed' e.g. the UI can be bound to this list so that the UI automatically updates when the data in the list change.
* stores a `UserPrefs` object that represents the user's preferences. This is exposed to the outside as a `ReadOnlyUserPrefs` objects.
* does not depend on any of the other three components (as the `Model` represents data entities of the domain, they should make sense on their own without depending on other components).

<puml src="diagrams/ModelSequenceDiagram.puml" alt="Interactions Inside the Model Component for the `deleteClient 1` Command" />

How the `Model` component works:

1. A command (e.g., `DeletePersonCommand`) calls the `Model` to delete a person.
2. The `ModelManager` calls the `AddressBook` to delete the person from the `UniquePersonList`.
3. The `UniquePersonList` deletes the person.

### Storage component

**API** : [`Storage.java`](https://github.com/AY2526S2-CS2103T-F14-2/tp/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/storage/Storage.java)

<puml src="diagrams/StorageClassDiagram.puml" width="550" />

The `Storage` component,
* can save both address book data and user preference data in JSON format, and read them back into corresponding objects.
* inherits from both `AddressBookStorage` and `UserPrefsStorage`, which means it can be treated as either one (if only the functionality of only one is needed).
* depends on some classes in the `Model` component (because the `Storage` component's job is to save/retrieve objects that belong to the `Model`)

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## **Implementation**

This section describes some noteworthy details on how certain features are implemented.

### \[Actual\] Person-pet relationship

Each `Person` (client) contains a `List<Pet>` representing their owned pets. This is a **one-to-many** relationship: one client can own multiple pets.

**Key characteristics of the Person-Pet model:**

* **Immutability**: `Person` objects are immutable. Operations like `addPet(Pet)` and `removePet(Pet)` return new `Person` instances rather than modifying the existing object. This design ensures thread safety and simplifies state management.

* **Client identity**: A client's uniqueness is determined by their **phone number**. Two clients with the same phone number are considered the same person, regardless of other fields. This is implemented in `Person#isSamePerson()`.

* **Pet identity**: A pet's uniqueness within an owner is determined by the **pet name**. Two pets belonging to the same owner cannot have the same name. This is validated when adding or editing pets.

* **Pet indexing**: Pets are indexed **globally** across all clients in the displayed list. For example, if Client 1 has pets A and B, and Client 2 has pet C, their indexes would be 1, 2, and 3 respectively. This sequential indexing is used by `editPet` and `deletePet` commands.

* **Pet-Client linking**: When adding a pet via `addPet`, the pet is linked to a client using the client's **phone number** (not the client's index). This ensures the link remains stable even when the client list is filtered or reordered.

### \[Proposed\] Undo/redo feature

#### Proposed Implementation

The proposed undo/redo mechanism is facilitated by `VersionedAddressBook`. It extends `AddressBook` with an undo/redo history, stored internally as an `addressBookStateList` and `currentStatePointer`. Additionally, it implements the following operations:

* `VersionedAddressBook#commit()` — Saves the current address book state in its history.
* `VersionedAddressBook#undo()` — Restores the previous address book state from its history.
* `VersionedAddressBook#redo()` — Restores a previously undone address book state from its history.

These operations are exposed in the `Model` interface as `Model#commitAddressBook()`, `Model#undoAddressBook()` and `Model#redoAddressBook()` respectively.

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the undo/redo mechanism behaves at each step.

Step 1. The user launches the application for the first time. The `VersionedAddressBook` will be initialized with the initial address book state, and the `currentStatePointer` pointing to that single address book state.

<puml src="diagrams/UndoRedoState0.puml" alt="UndoRedoState0" />

Step 2. The user executes `deleteClient 5` command to delete the 5th client. Internally, the command calls `Model#commitAddressBook()`, causing the modified state of the address book after the `deleteClient 5` command executes to be saved in the `addressBookStateList`, and the `currentStatePointer` is shifted to the newly inserted address book state.

<puml src="diagrams/UndoRedoState1.puml" alt="UndoRedoState1" />

Step 3. The user executes `addClient n/David p/PHONE …​` to add a new person. The command also calls `Model#commitAddressBook()`, causing another modified address book state to be saved into the `addressBookStateList`.

<puml src="diagrams/UndoRedoState2.puml" alt="UndoRedoState2" />

<box type="info" seamless>

**Note:** If a command fails its execution, it will not call `Model#commitAddressBook()`, so the address book state will not be saved into the `addressBookStateList`.

</box>

Step 4. The user now decides that adding the client was a mistake, and decides to undo that action by executing the `undo` command. The `undo` command will call `Model#undoAddressBook()`, which will shift the `currentStatePointer` once to the left, pointing it to the previous address book state, and restores the address book to that state.

<puml src="diagrams/UndoRedoState3.puml" alt="UndoRedoState3" />


<box type="info" seamless>

**Note:** If the `currentStatePointer` is at index 0, pointing to the initial AddressBook state, then there are no previous AddressBook states to restore. The `undo` command uses `Model#canUndoAddressBook()` to check if this is the case. If so, it will return an error to the user rather
than attempting to perform the undo.

</box>

The following sequence diagram shows how an undo operation goes through the `Logic` component:

<puml src="diagrams/UndoSequenceDiagram-Logic.puml" alt="UndoSequenceDiagram-Logic" />

<box type="info" seamless>

**Note:** The lifeline for `UndoCommand` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.

</box>

Similarly, how an undo operation goes through the `Model` component is shown below:

<puml src="diagrams/UndoSequenceDiagram-Model.puml" alt="UndoSequenceDiagram-Model" />

The `redo` command does the opposite — it calls `Model#redoAddressBook()`, which shifts the `currentStatePointer` once to the right, pointing to the previously undone state, and restores the address book to that state.

<box type="info" seamless>

**Note:** If the `currentStatePointer` is at index `addressBookStateList.size() - 1`, pointing to the latest address book state, then there are no undone AddressBook states to restore. The `redo` command uses `Model#canRedoAddressBook()` to check if this is the case. If so, it will return an error to the user rather than attempting to perform the redo.

</box>

Step 5. The user then decides to execute the command `list`. Commands that do not modify the address book, such as `list`, will usually not call `Model#commitAddressBook()`, `Model#undoAddressBook()` or `Model#redoAddressBook()`. Thus, the `addressBookStateList` remains unchanged.

<puml src="diagrams/UndoRedoState4.puml" alt="UndoRedoState4" />

Step 6. The user executes `clear`, which calls `Model#commitAddressBook()`. Since the `currentStatePointer` is not pointing at the end of the `addressBookStateList`, all address book states after the `currentStatePointer` will be purged. Reason: It no longer makes sense to redo the `add n/David …​` command. This is the behavior that most modern desktop applications follow.

<puml src="diagrams/UndoRedoState5.puml" alt="UndoRedoState5" />

The following activity diagram summarizes what happens when a user executes a new command:

<puml src="diagrams/CommitActivityDiagram.puml" width="250" />

#### Design considerations:

**Aspect: How undo & redo executes:**

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Saves the entire address book.
  * Pros: Easy to implement.
  * Cons: May have performance issues in terms of memory usage.

* **Alternative 2:** Individual command knows how to undo/redo by
  itself.
  * Pros: Will use less memory (e.g. for `delete`, just save the person being deleted).
  * Cons: We must ensure that the implementation of each individual command are correct.

4. The response to any user action should become visible within 2 seconds.
5. The app should not crash due to a user action (e.g., entering an invalid command, or deleting a client that does not exist).
6. The app should not crash due to a programmer error (e.g., null pointer exception, or array index out of bounds exception).
7. Should not have a steep learning curve for users who are reasonably comfortable using CLI apps.

      Expected: If a client or pet matches the keywords, the client and all their pets are displayed.

## **Appendix: Effort**

Our project extended AB3 by including pets as an additional attribute for person.
We changed the layout of the UI to make it more appealing.
Extending the existing commands to include a new entity should have saved a significant amount of effort, but adapting the tests turned out to be very tedious.
An unexpected challenge was addressing pets with indexes, since we only had an ObservablePersonList to work with.

## **Appendix: Planned enhancements**

Team size: 5

1. **Make find function more specific:** The current find function returns pets that are not related to the search.
The find function can be made more specific by saving an additional predicate in the model that takes in a pair of pet and person.
The methods `getFilteredPersonList()`, `getPerson()` and `getPet()` will use the additional predicate to do another round of filtering.
